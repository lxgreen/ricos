  "<p class=\"font_8\">Most people who are in good health and able-bodied will be able to complete some, if not all,  of the trails.

Park monitors are always on the ground to offer coaching or instructions. </p><br /><br /><br /><p class=\"font_8\">The Adventure Park employs an \"always locked on\" climbing system, which utilizes interlocking carabiners (safety clips). This innovative safety system keeps climbers locked into the cable system while they are on the high ropes courses and ziplines. </p><br /><br /><br /><p class=\"font_8\">All participants must sign a liability waiver each time they visit the park.  An electronic waiver will be included with your online purchase confirmation.  </p><br /></p><br />",

  "<p class=\"font_8\">Children 6 and younger must start on the Li'l Rascals course and practice their skills with supervision by a parent. If the parent feels the child can handle the yellow course (the easiest course on the \"big course\"), she or he should ask a staff member to watch the child navigate the Lil' Rascals course first before moving to the Yellow. This 'graduation' to the yellow course is based on staff review.  Parent supervision is required at all times on all courses.   </p><br />",

Purchase in denominations of $100, $50, $20. You will receive a Gift Certificate Code, which can be sent to you, or directly to the recipient. They can redeem any amount of the gift certificate using the code, towards any purchase online or on-site at the Adventure Park. Any leftover amount will be held as a credit in the account.

For example, you could buy vouchers for an Adult or Child Zip &amp; Climb ticket, a Child Zip &amp; Climb ticket, or a Lil' Rascals Playground ticket. These are valid towards products, not dollar amounts. So if you have a voucher for an Adult Ticket, and redeem it next year after the price goes up, you don't have to pay the price difference because it's valid for the product, not the dollar amount. They never expire. Vouchers are issued when guests cancel a visito or are rescheduled due to rain. </p><br />",
