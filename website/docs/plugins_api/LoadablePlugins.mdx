## Loadable plugins

Loadable lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component.
Loadable can help you “lazy-load” just the things that are currently needed by the user, which can dramatically improve the performance of your app.

For using loadable plugins (meantime for viewer only), you should import plugin from loadable entry.

### Usage Example

```jsx {5}
import { pluginImage } from 'wix-rich-content-plugin-image/loadable/viewer';
import 'wix-rich-content-plugin-image/dist/styles.min.css';

return (
  <RicosViewer plugins={[pluginImage()]}>
    <RichContentViewer />
  </RicosViewer>
);
```
