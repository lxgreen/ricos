## Loadable plugins

Loadable lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component.
Loadable can help you “lazy-load” just the things that are currently needed by the user, which can dramatically improve the performance of your app.

Note: loadable plugins have different import. For using loadable plugins (meantime for viewer only), you should import plugins from `loadable/viewer` entry.

### Usage Example

```jsx {5}
import { pluginImage } from 'wix-rich-content-plugin-image/loadable/viewer';

return (
  <RicosViewer plugins={[pluginImage()]}>
    <RichContentViewer />
  </RicosViewer>
);
```
